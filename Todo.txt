To do:
	Fix upgrade text order.
	Spell check. -Data available. - Affect -> Effect.
	Some bug involving screen jumping up and down, probably caused by number of decimal points changing from 0 to 3 rapidly.
	Readd import/export.
	Add warning for unsupported browsers.
	Add upgrade text to item objects.
	Remove total data hacked (maybe?).
	Make load() check for undefined stuff.
	Make save() not save things that should be constants.
Done:
	Keep data on screen as you scroll down.
	Make an ID for each flex-container, have them display: none; by default. When revealed, set to display: flex;.
	Fix font size on large monitors.
	Change decimal points to 2 (maybe?). When above 1000 bytes.
	Add trailing zeroes to formatNumbers. When above 1000 bytes.
	Add more number sizes.
	Add formatNumbers() for auto buying.
