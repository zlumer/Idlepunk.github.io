To do.
	Keep data on screen as you scroll down.
	Add more number sizes.
	Add formatNumbers() for auto buying.
	Fix upgrade text orders.
	Spell check. -Data available. - Affect -> Effect.
	Change decimal points to 2 (maybe?).
	Add trailing zeroes to formatNumbers.
	Some bug involving screen jumping up and down, probably caused by number of decimal points changing from 0 to 3 rapidly.
	Readd save/export.
	Add max text size.
	Add warning for unsupported browsers.
	Add upgrade text to item objects.
	Remove total data hacked (maybe?).

Done.
